# BarTracker App

BarTracker is a crowdsourced app that provides real-time information on bar occupancy and wait times. It combines user-generated data and location-based insights to help users decide where to go for the best experience.

## About This Project

This repository contains the source code for BarTracker, a personal project I developed to solve the problem of unpredictable wait times and overcrowding at bars and venues. The app gives users access to real-time information about popular spots in their area.

## Key Features

- **Crowdsourced Data**: Users can submit occupancy levels and line wait times
- **Location-Based Insights**: Shows users venues near their location (when location access is allowed)
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive design for easy navigation and data submission

## Technical Overview

BarTracker is built using:
- Python/Django backend
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis/Celery for task management
- Location-based services
- Mobile-responsive frontend

This project demonstrates my experience with:
- Full-stack web development
- Database design and management
- Asynchronous task processing
- Location-based services integration
- User authentication and data collection

## Project Status

This is a personal project currently under development. While the code is publicly visible, it's not actively maintained for public use or contributions.
